Lab 1: Implement sorted list of words, using arrays. Uses dynamic array expansion when array size is full. Operations include find, add, remove, find amount of words in an alphabetical range,returning sublists, and more. Test class and report included.

Lab 2: Similar to Lab 1, except using singly linked lists. All operations from lab 1 exist, plus an operation to merge two linked lists, running in O(n) (each list can only be processed once). Report included.

Lab 3/4: A class HugeInteger cabable of representing arbitrarily large integer numbers. Contains arthimetic operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparing two HugeInteger. Test class and report included. This class mimics java.math.BigInteger from the Java frameworks, and the two classes are compared in the report.

Lab 5: Class BSTree is a binary search tree storing nodes each representing integers. Operations include printing numbers in increasing order, printing in level order, and more. BSTree uses stack class MyStack and queue MyQueue to assist in some operations. Test class included.
